Regulators are also demanding greater use of structured, machine-readable data in companies’

companies to tag data in their financial statements using eXtensible Business Reporting Language
(“XBRL”), which is a royalty-free, international standard designed specifically for digital reporting of
financial, performance, risk and compliance information. XBRL provides a unique, machine-readable tag
